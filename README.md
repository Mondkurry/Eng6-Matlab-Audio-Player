# Eng6: Matlab Audio Player
## Collaborators: Aryan Mondkar, Yuvraj Jadav, Varun Rao

We created a Music Player using MATLAB for our Engineering 6 Final Project. Using manipulation of audio frequencies and amplitudes, I coded the volume adjustment, playback speed adjustment, the merge feature that played two overlaying songs, and all associated visuals and graphics. Yuvraj coded the base features such as the pause/play, shuffle, song Selection, skip, and rewind. Varun focused on the Thinkspeak API usage that allowed us to publish listener data to the web in real time as well as collaborating on the merge feature that merged two different songs.

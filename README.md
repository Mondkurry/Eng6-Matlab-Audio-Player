# Eng6-Matlab-Audio-Player
##Collaborators: Aryan Mondkar, Yuvraj Jadav, Varun Rao

We created a Music Player using MATLAB for our Engineering 6 Final Project. Using manipulation of audio frequencies and amplitudes, I coded the volume adjustment, playback speed adjustment, the merge feature that played two overlaying songs, and all associated visuals and graphics. Yuvraj coded the base features such as the pause/play, shuffle, song Selection, skip, and rewind. Varun focused on the Thinkspeak API usage that was required as well as collaborating on the merge feature that merged two different songs.
